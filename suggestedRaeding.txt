    A Book Apart series, especially the books on HTML5 (Jeremy Keith) and CSS3 (Dan Cederholm). Great primers and reference material.
    A List Apart is a bi-weekly web journal that Iâ€™d consider required reading for any web developer, newbie or experienced.
    Smashing Magazine is a pretty classic web resource.
    Hacker News is a consistent source of news articles and discussion.

For any developers who also design, I regularly read:

    Beautiful Pixels for design trends in mobile and web apps.
    Sidebar is a new link blog where I discover a lot of design related gems.

Finally for the audio inclined:

    Shop Talk is a web design and development podcast hosted by CSS whiz Chris Coyier.
